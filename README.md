# Mark of The Beastro

Simple, custom Wordpress website using PHP and custom graphics. Created for a local vegan restaurant. 
Worked with client to create custom graphics and web layout to help divert some business from delivery apps to in-house delivey and pick-up orders.

Custom icons that fit the aesthic of the restaurant were created by drawing on the in-house deliery scooter and the vinatge neon sign on the building.
