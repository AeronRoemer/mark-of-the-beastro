# Mark of The Beastro

Simple, custom Wordpress website using PHP and custom graphics. Created for a local vegan restaurant. 
Worked with client to create custom graphics and web layout to help divert some business from delivery apps to in-house delivey and pick-up orders.

## Basic Structure

Following Wordpress structure conventions, there are headers, footers and other page templates that are used. The site also redirects users to an ordering page that's tied to Square products used behind the counter for orders/delivery.
